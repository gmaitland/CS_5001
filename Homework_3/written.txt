# I think Option 1 will correctly prompt the user. The
# way I reasoned was by thinking about the contrapositive.
# 'If day is Sat or if day is Sun. Then that is a valid day'

# For the option that does not work, the problem is that the
# program thinks that good inputs (like "Sat") are invalid.
# This is because the condition of the while loop will always
# be true.
