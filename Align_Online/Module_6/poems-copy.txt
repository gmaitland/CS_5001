ROSES ARE RED
Violets are blue
Marshmallow factories
Are covered in goo

ROSES ARE RED
Violets are blue
If you count in binary
You'll never have 2

The Math section is red
Social Studies is blue
I have too much homework
I want to cry

ROSES ARE RED
Violets are blue
Please don't get stuck
In the spilled glue

Roses are purple
Violets are green
I'm just here revving
My limousine

ROSES ARE RED
Violets are blue
There is no try
Do not or do

ROSES ARE RED
Violets are blue
Think I'll paint them
On my shoe

ROSES ARE RED
Violets are blue
I'm too cynical
And yet too cheesy

Roses are rosy
Violets are violet
I want to be
A submarine pilot

ROSES ARE RED
Violets are blue
Something something
Pikachu

ROSES ARE RED
Violets are blue
Illuminati
They're watching you

ROSES ARE RED
Violets are blue
I'm running low on ideas
We're almost through

ROSES ARE RED
Violets are blue
You're still here?
Good job you
